### What is [[Potential Energy]] 's relationship to force if I know nothing about kinetic energy or total mechanical energy?
	- {{cloze Since ΔU = -W = -F * Δx, we can say that as x approaches 0, dU/dx = -F which is to say that on a potential energy vs position graph, the *negative* slope of the graph is equal to the force being done}}
- ### Relationship between angular acceleration and angular velocity:
