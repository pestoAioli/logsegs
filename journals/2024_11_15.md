- Essmail lecture on quantum mechanics:
	- when referring to electrons, energy is not continuous, but rather, discreet
	- ΔE = h(μ)
	- ƛ means wavelength
	- μ per second is frequency (in hertz)
	- ƛμ = c <-- speed of light
	- Schrodingers wave equation(trident symbol) squared gives you orbital probability
	- if l quantum number gives shape (0,1,2,3 -> s,p,d,f), m gives you possible orientations
