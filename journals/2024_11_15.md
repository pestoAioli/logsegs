- Essmail lecture on quantum mechanics:
	- when referring to electrons, energy is not continuous, but rather, discreet
	- ΔE = h(μ)
	- ƛ means wavelength
	- μ per second is frequency (in hertz)
	- ƛμ = c <-- speed of light
	- Schrodingers wave equation(trident symbol) squared gives you orbital probability
	- if l quantum number gives shape (0,1,2,3 -> s,p,d,f), m gives you possible orientations
	- periodic table:
		- every two groups are 1 orbital?
	- energy of pairing vs Δ
		- when energy levels are one apart, energy of pairing is greater than Δ
	- dynamics of electron movement is probabilistic
	- duality of nature:
		- light can behave like wave or particle depending on what conditions it is under
		- when being observed, electron behaves in one way, changes when observed
	- hybridization only happens during bonding to create equality within the orbitals
